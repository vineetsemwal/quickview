  QuickView
-----------------------------
QuickView is a wicket component(RepeatingView) ,it lets you add new rows or remove the rows without the need to
 re-render the whole repeater again when used with ajax components like AjaxLink or AjaxItemsNavigator.AjaxItemsNavigator which is provided in this package
 creates new rows on click.
Quickview can be also be used with PagingNavigator or AjaxPagingNavigator .it should work in all the scenarios where the DataView works.
the way of using it is exactly like DataView .the only difference is you will have to set a reuse constant which is just an enum,
the behavior of the quickview depends on that enum.

Please use simple examples which comes with the package .

thank you !

Please note the idea/inspiration to write quickview came from Igor Vaynberg's article

QuickView is based on Apache Wicket.
